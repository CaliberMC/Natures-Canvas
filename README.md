Natures Canvas is an add-on for Caliber Mod this mod.  It provides world generation and custom biomes along with numerous
new block types to really spice up your Minecraft world!

Keep in mind, this is a Beta and not all features have been added to the mod. Upon release of new versions, 
additional features will be added and I will do my best not to break any existing ones. Now that the mod is out of Alpha
most features included in the mod will be here to stay. I look forward to providing a bug free and highly useable survival 
friendly mod for everyone to use. If you have any ideas or feature suggestions please let me know in the comments or on 
the issues/feature request page on github.

Keep this mod bookmarked because it will be in development for a long time to come.
